# Library-Management-in-C

# Project Info
In this project I create a record log for books in C. I use file management in this project to store all the data and I also added a simple password system as an added security feature. It also has a GUI and displays the date and time at the bottom. Password to access the code is srm. This code has different functions for different purposes it has one to add books into the library, one to delete, one to search for books, one to issue the books, one to view the books, one to edit books and the rest are mainly for the password.
